[...] Prior to its failure, the bank was one of the largest Icelandic banks with assets of ISK 3,058 billion in December 2007 and a market capitalization of ISK 383 billion.  It began operation in 1885 and was instrumental in the economic development of business and industry in Iceland. From 1927 to 1961, the bank acted as the central bank until it was replaced by the Central Bank of Iceland, although this interest was primarily directed towards note issuance rather than monetary policy.  The bank [...] Liberalisation of financial services, beginning in 1986, opened up new opportunities, which the bank managed to take advantage of despite some economic adversity. In 1997, Landsbanki was incorporated as a limited-liability company, and the ensuing privatization finally concluded in 2003. Landsbanki then operated as a privately owned bank, competing in a free market, with substantial international activities added to its traditional Icelandic operations.[citation needed]",

It began operation in 1885 and was instrumental in the economic development of business and industry in Iceland.

To determine whether they primarily serve as a Tax Expert, Legal Expert, Administrator, or Investment Advisor, it's crucial to understand the types of clients they serve and the specific services offered to those clients. An additional query focusing on their client types will help narrow down their specialization and primary role.
