Therefore, I am setting needs_more_info to true and providing the additional_query_string 'BNP PRIVATE BANK & TRUST BAH investment services' to gather more targeted information. Since we are at the maximum iteration, I will focus the query on investment services as that is a common role for private banks and trusts, and it is better to have some information than none at all.

Knowing their clientele (e.g., high-net-worth individuals, corporations, trusts) would help determine their primary role. For example, if they primarily serve trusts, it suggests an administrator role. If they serve high-net-worth individuals with complex financial needs, it could indicate an investment advisor or tax expert role. Therefore, I need more information to confidently classify the intermediary's primary role.

Knowing their clientele (e.g., high-net-worth individuals, corporations, trusts) would help determine their primary role. For example, if they primarily serve trusts, it suggests an administrator role. If they serve high-net-worth individuals with complex financial needs, it could indicate an investment advisor or tax expert role.
