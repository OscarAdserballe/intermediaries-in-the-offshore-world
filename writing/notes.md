Motivation:

Public Economics: First, motivating from public finance; the top-end problem: Demand-side to Supply-side in the literature.

Ok, so focusing more on the supply-side. Alstads√¶ter et al. (2019), Lafitte (2024) as primary examples.

(Mostly) IPE literature: we know a lot about the location of these offshore lcoations, we know a lot about the people demand these services

But we don't know that much about the people in the middle. A couple of scattered results:
1. Harrington (2016) and Hoang (2022) providing solid ethnographic evidence in the form of micro-sociological accounts
2. A bit from the Tax Experiment in Chile from 2024
3. And a little about the location of them.

At the same time, IPE literature ever-increasing focus on these professionals in the middle. Incredibly important - and adding to that supply-side public economics literature.

Contributing with a few results, drawn from the ICIJ data, about the patterns of specialisations of intermediaries:
* Corroboaring a few paper son the locations of where htey're to be found
* Patterns of client specialisation: in a few countries and
* Instrumetns and Legal Technologies
* And trying to affirm a bit of a typology presented in the EU (2017) paper.

Results in line with the notions of relational capitalism consistent with: Neely (2021), Hoang (2022), Harrington (2016), 

Grannoveter 1973: Social Network as a way of linking micro and macro-evidence.


#### In the Applied Network Science branch of things:

Kejriwal \& Dang 2020: Deviating from traditional power-law structure. 

"It should be noted that ICIJ itself claims on its website, dedicated to the Panama Papers (we provide a link in the next section), that mere presence of an entity in the Panama Papers does not suggest that it is engaged in shadowy or illicit activities. In this article, in keeping with this recommendation, we take a more agnostic view and aim to uncover structural insights using the framework of network science"


https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/690125:

"It was really unusual. The degree of fragmentation is something I have never seen before," said Kejriwal. "I'm not aware of any other network that has this kind of fragmentation."

Some very special properties of the network



#### The PANA studies: EP's Committee of Inquiry into Money Laundering, Tax Avoidance and Tax Evasion

Two very relevant papers:
Willem Pieter DE GROEN (CEPS) and III: Role of advisors and intermediaries in the schemes revealed in the Panama Papers



Overall policy recommendation from both: Sharpen up levels of self-regulation in these professions usch that they don't negatively ocntribute to the phenomenon of tax avoidance and evasion.

Most intermediaries not located in onshore jurisdictions, so we can't directly enforce regulations against them. But, onshore jurisdictions can can put pressure on offshore jurisdictions to broaden the scope of regulations they have there (de Groen 2017)

* How much hsa been done in this respect? What are the existing regulations?




### The Race Between Tax Enforcement and Tax Planning: Evidence from a Natural Experiment in Chile

Authors: Bustos, Pomeranz, Serrato, Zucman, Belda

Using imlementation of OECD transfer pricing standards as natural experiment. Result: Did not reduce propensity of multinationals "to make tax-motivated payments to their foreign affiliates" and nothing on tax either.

Three steps:
1. Building conceptual framework, implementing some quantitative analysis using administrative micro-data and conduct in-depth qualitatiative interviews to understand the mechanisms at play.
2. Effects of OECD reform:
    * First, showing multinationals engage in tax-motivated transactions using intra-firm flows, exploiting changes in tax rates. 1\% increase in tax rate of destination country, associated with increase in payments to affiliates of between 4.5\% and 4.9\%.
    * Second, diff-in-diff of whether reform was effective at reducing multinationals' propensity to mkae intra-group payments to lower-tax countries.
3. In-depth interviews with transfer pricing experts in Chilean MNEs and consulting firms. Big Four consultants specialising in transfer pricing increased from 8 to 95. Consulting firms see additional enforcement as a business opportunity! Intermediaries benefit from regulation!    

Unlike what has been found for small firms with simple accounting structures, strengthening reporting requirements and paper trails insufficietn to icnrease tax collection from large firms.
Concretely, two lessons:
1. Importance of paper trails for tax monitoring
2. Need for credible enforcement.

###### Role of the Tax Advisory Industry

In-depth qualitiative interviews with experts.
Six primary insights:
1. Reform boon to the tax advisory industry
2. Strong surge in demand for specialised consulting services because of complexity
3. 
4. Supply was highly ealastic: advisory industry could justs redirect professionals to Chile
5. Tax planning advice: centralise cost centeres in fewer locatoins
6. Tax administrators heavily outmatched by consulting firms in number of staff as well as salaries.


### Unfollow the Money

Authors: Stausholm, Garcia-Bernardo

Geographical mapping of corporate tax advisors in line with recent trend of empahsising improtance of micro-level actors.
Empirical approach based on LinkedIn
Located in EU and the OECD rather than in places targetted. Correlates with locations where there's managerial and financial activity.

"States enable tax avoidance, but micro-level actors facilitate it"

States only a necessary condition; not sufficinet.

Results: Really in the major financial centres of the world. New York, San Francisco, London, Hong Kong, Singapore, Zurich, Amsterdam, Luxembourg.


# Future Classification

Are these intermediaries international? 

Are they located offshore or onshore? (cf. Stausholm)


# Questions for Rasmus

What the hell about regulation? Why can we not just legally punish attempts at tax avoidance, if the intent was so lie for example Zucman mentions in his book are laws in place in the US that would allow for this?

Is it sufficiently theoretical?
