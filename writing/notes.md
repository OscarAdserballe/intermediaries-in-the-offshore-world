#### The PANA studies: EP's Committee of Inquiry into Money Laundering, Tax Avoidance and Tax Evasion

Two very relevant papers:
Willem Pieter DE GROEN (CEPS) and III: Role of advisors and intermediaries in the schemes revealed in the Panama Papers

Overall policy recommendation from both: Sharpen up levels of self-regulation in these professions usch that they don't negatively ocntribute to the phenomenon of tax avoidance and evasion.

Most intermediaries not located in onshore jurisdictions, so we can't directly enforce regulations against them. But, onshore jurisdictions can can put pressure on offshore jurisdictions to broaden the scope of regulations they have there (de Groen 2017)

* How much hsa been done in this respect? What are the existing regulations?

### The Race Between Tax Enforcement and Tax Planning: Evidence from a Natural Experiment in Chile

Authors: Bustos, Pomeranz, Serrato, Zucman, Belda

Using imlementation of OECD transfer pricing standards as natural experiment. Result: Did not reduce propensity of multinationals "to make tax-motivated payments to their foreign affiliates" and nothing on tax either.

Three steps:
1. Building conceptual framework, implementing some quantitative analysis using administrative micro-data and conduct in-depth qualitatiative interviews to understand the mechanisms at play.
2. Effects of OECD reform:
    * First, showing multinationals engage in tax-motivated transactions using intra-firm flows, exploiting changes in tax rates. 1\% increase in tax rate of destination country, associated with increase in payments to affiliates of between 4.5\% and 4.9\%.
    * Second, diff-in-diff of whether reform was effective at reducing multinationals' propensity to mkae intra-group payments to lower-tax countries.
3. In-depth interviews with transfer pricing experts in Chilean MNEs and consulting firms. Big Four consultants specialising in transfer pricing increased from 8 to 95. Consulting firms see additional enforcement as a business opportunity! Intermediaries benefit from regulation!    

Unlike what has been found for small firms with simple accounting structures, strengthening reporting requirements and paper trails insufficietn to icnrease tax collection from large firms.
Concretely, two lessons:
1. Importance of paper trails for tax monitoring
2. Need for credible enforcement.

###### Role of the Tax Advisory Industry

In-depth qualitiative interviews with experts.
Six primary insights:
1. Reform boon to the tax advisory industry
2. Strong surge in demand for specialised consulting services because of complexity
3. 
4. Supply was highly ealastic: advisory industry could justs redirect professionals to Chile
5. Tax planning advice: centralise cost centeres in fewer locatoins
6. Tax administrators heavily outmatched by consulting firms in number of staff as well as salaries.


### Unfollow the Money

Authors: Stausholm, Garcia-Bernardo

Geographical mapping of corporate tax advisors in line with recent trend of empahsising improtance of micro-level actors.
Empirical approach based on LinkedIn
Located in EU and the OECD rather than in places targetted. Correlates with locations where there's managerial and financial activity.

"States enable tax avoidance, but micro-level actors facilitate it"

States only a necessary condition; not sufficinet.

Results: Really in the major financial centres of the world. New York, San Francisco, London, Hong Kong, Singapore, Zurich, Amsterdam, Luxembourg.

"The tax practitioners we are interested in are solely those who are responsible
for managing and advising on corporate taxation for larger firms. Since this is not
an established function with set titles and accreditations, titles, and backgrounds
can vary between firms and countries. We therefore read job ads and LinkedIn
profiles containing the different types of titles to ensure that we understood the
practitioners behind the titles. Illustrative examples include an ‘International Tax
Manager’ at a large shipping firm, a ‘Tax Manager’ at a large Big Four consulting
firm, and a ‘Head of Corporate Tax’ at a large international bank"
