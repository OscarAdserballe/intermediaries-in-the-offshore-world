Kejriwal \& Dang 2020: Deviating from traditional power-law structure. 

"It should be noted that ICIJ itself claims on its website, dedicated to the Panama Papers (we provide a link in the next section), that mere presence of an entity in the Panama Papers does not suggest that it is engaged in shadowy or illicit activities. In this article, in keeping with this recommendation, we take a more agnostic view and aim to uncover structural insights using the framework of network science"

"It was really unusual. The degree of fragmentation is something I have never seen before," said Kejriwal. "I'm not aware of any other network that has this kind of fragmentation."

#### The PANA studies: EP's Committee of Inquiry into Money Laundering, Tax Avoidance and Tax Evasion

Two very relevant papers:
Willem Pieter DE GROEN (CEPS) and III: Role of advisors and intermediaries in the schemes revealed in the Panama Papers



Overall policy recommendation from both: Sharpen up levels of self-regulation in these professions usch that they don't negatively ocntribute to the phenomenon of tax avoidance and evasion.

Most intermediaries not located in onshore jurisdictions, so we can't directly enforce regulations against them. But, onshore jurisdictions can can put pressure on offshore jurisdictions to broaden the scope of regulations they have there (de Groen 2017)

* How much hsa been done in this respect? What are the existing regulations?




### The Race Between Tax Enforcement and Tax Planning: Evidence from a Natural Experiment in Chile

Authors: Bustos, Pomeranz, Serrato, Zucman, Belda

Using imlementation of OECD transfer pricing standards as natural experiment. Result: Did not reduce propensity of multinationals "to make tax-motivated payments to their foreign affiliates" and nothing on tax either.

Three steps:
1. Building conceptual framework, implementing some quantitative analysis using administrative micro-data and conduct in-depth qualitatiative interviews to understand the mechanisms at play.
2. Effects of OECD reform:
    * First, showing multinationals engage in tax-motivated transactions using intra-firm flows, exploiting changes in tax rates. 1\% increase in tax rate of destination country, associated with increase in payments to affiliates of between 4.5\% and 4.9\%.
    * Second, diff-in-diff of whether reform was effective at reducing multinationals' propensity to mkae intra-group payments to lower-tax countries.
3. In-depth interviews with transfer pricing experts in Chilean MNEs and consulting firms. Big Four consultants specialising in transfer pricing increased from 8 to 95. Consulting firms see additional enforcement as a business opportunity! Intermediaries benefit from regulation!    

Unlike what has been found for small firms with simple accounting structures, strengthening reporting requirements and paper trails insufficietn to icnrease tax collection from large firms.
Concretely, two lessons:
1. Importance of paper trails for tax monitoring
2. Need for credible enforcement.

###### Role of the Tax Advisory Industry

In-depth qualitiative interviews with experts.
Six primary insights:
1. Reform boon to the tax advisory industry
2. Strong surge in demand for specialised consulting services because of complexity
3. 
4. Supply was highly ealastic: advisory industry could justs redirect professionals to Chile
5. Tax planning advice: centralise cost centeres in fewer locatoins
6. Tax administrators heavily outmatched by consulting firms in number of staff as well as salaries.


### Unfollow the Money

Geographical mapping of corporate tax advisors in line with recent trend of empahsising improtance of micro-level actors.
Empirical approach based on LinkedIn
Located in EU and the OECD rather than in places targetted. Correlates with locations where there's managerial and financial activity.



# Models we need to implement

Simple model for an intermediary to benefit of diversifying into multiple jurisdictions. This is the demand-side.

Among intermediaries: compeititon among them? How can we see that into their network structure.

Centrality measures case studies. 


# Classification

Are these intermediaries international? 

Are they located offshore or onshore? (cf. Stausholm)


# Questions for Rasmus

What the hell about regulation? Why can we not just legally punish attempts at tax avoidance, if the intent was so lie for example Zucman mentions in his book are laws in place in the US that would allow for this?

# Spiderweb Capitalism by Kimberly Hoang: Coherent Notes

## Introduction: The Hidden World of Elite Capitalism

Kimberly Hoang's work delves into the often hidden and exclusive elite social circles of capitalism, which are typically only accessible through "gateways" such as Ivy League institutions (Harvard and Wharton are specifically mentioned as central to financial circles) and top preparatory schools.

* **Central Study & Metaphor:** The book's primary focus is on Vietnam, informed by Hoang's experiences and research there, including exposure to the harsh realities of frontier markets that can intersect with issues like human trafficking. This research informs the book's central metaphor: **"Spiderweb Capitalism."** This concept describes how capitalism, especially in frontier markets, operates heavily on **relational capital**.
* **Contextual Research:** Hoang's work aligns with studies like Brooke Harrington's 2016 book, "Capital without Borders," which also involved interviews with elites (e.g., a CEO who alluded to multiple hidden layers of influence beyond even high-net-worth individuals).
* **Operating in "The Gray":** To succeed in these circles, one must master operating in the "gray area" between legal and illegal activities. Standard business practices, like obtaining permits for private equity ventures, are often impossible without navigating this space.
* **Hidden Elites – The "Big Spiders":** The true power players (e.g., "every officer chairman") remain invisible, their names absent from public records and media. These are the "big spiders" who hide behind "smaller spiders" (e.g., CEOs visible to the public) who take the fall if illicit activities are uncovered. The individuals we see are often not the ultimate beneficiaries or decision-makers, who remain insulated from prosecution.
* **Research Question & Goals:**
    * **Primary Question:** How do individuals and firms capitalize on risky frontier markets? Hoang's answer: by operating "in the gray."
    * **Secondary Goals:**
        1.  To expose the structure of "Spiderweb Capitalism."
        2.  To examine the individuals and mechanisms that move money globally.
        3.  To reveal how connections in the "gray space" are essential for establishing businesses in these markets.
* **Methodology:** Hoang conducted "front office global ethnography," traveling 350,000 miles and interviewing over 300 individuals, from high-net-worth individuals (HNWIs, top 10%) to ultra-high-net-worth individuals (UHNWIs, top 0.1%), within highly academic circles.

## Clarifying the Spiderweb Metaphor

The "spiderweb" is structured with layers of actors:

* **The Builders/Big Spiders:** At the very top, often hidden and unseen, orchestrating the web.
* **Subordinate Spiders (Intermediaries):** These are crucial for the web's functioning:
    * Private wealth managers, fund managers.
    * Accountants and auditors.
    * Bankers.
    * Secretaries and nominees (individuals acting on behalf of others).
    * **Fixers:** Locally employed individuals primarily responsible for handling bribes and navigating local complexities on behalf of foreign investors.
* **Eastward Shift:** There's a noted gradual shift of financial activity from West to East, partly influenced by increased Western regulations like the **Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA)**. FATCA requires foreign financial institutions to report on the assets of their U.S. clients to the U.S. Treasury to limit tax evasion, fraud, and terrorism financing. This has led to significant concessions (e.g., from Switzerland) and fueled the growth of an industry of independent managers who serve as intermediaries with offshore custodial bases.
* **Regulation & Risk Offloading:** The presence of heavy regulations and sanctions (especially if U.S. persons are involved) means that illicit or gray-area activities are often pushed onto local fixers. This creates a balance of responsibilities, particularly under tight timeframes or when pre-existing local relationships are absent.

## The Function of Offshore Financial Centers

Offshore financial centers serve several key functions for global elites:

1.  **Privacy and Secrecy:** Hugely important, especially for individuals from countries with contested governments or a significant risk of expropriation, asset confiscation, or even kidnapping.
2.  **Tax Management:** Navigating the line between tax avoidance (legal) and tax evasion (illegal).
3.  **Asset Protection ("Ring-fencing"):** Local banking institutions in frontier markets may not be insulated from instability or government interference. Moving money into offshore vehicles helps ring-fence assets from prospective liabilities.
4.  **Mitigating Risk in Frontier Markets:** Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs) are commonly used to structure investments and mitigate the substantial risks involved in these countries.
5.  **Moving Capital:** A key challenge is sourcing financing from Western/foreign investors and moving it onshore into frontier markets. This often involves structures like private equity funds setting up multiple SPVs that feed into local investments.
6.  **Selling Frontier Markets:** Private equity fund managers play a crucial role in "selling" these markets to Western investors, often by attempting to make the distant and unfamiliar seem more local or by presenting a very specific, appealing vision of these countries (e.g., comparing a frontier market location favorably to places like Los Angeles or New York).

## Relational Capitalism and "Homoerotic Bonding"

A significant emphasis is placed on **relational capitalism**. Building trust and connections is paramount. This often involves "homoerotic bonding traditions" – vivid descriptions of social events like parties where investors bond with local officials and forge necessary connections.

## Chapter 2/3: Varieties of Corruption and Bribes – "Playing in the Gray"

This section details how deals are financed, how money moves from offshore vehicles back onshore, and the specifics of operating in the "gray area."

* **Continuum of Legality:** There's a recognized continuum between legal and illegal activities. Foreign investors often try to offload the riskiest functions (e.g., bribery, which may be necessary to conduct business) to local agents.
* **Typology of Actors based on Corruption:**
    * **Anti-Corrupters:** Maintain a strict stance against corruption, usually due to the threat of regulation in their home countries.
    * **Greasers:** Make small "facilitation payments" (e.g., for licenses or permits).
    * **Drivers:** Engage in "multiplication strategies" such as strategic gift-giving or bundling brokerage services to facilitate investments.
    * **Thieves:** Actively engage in activities like money laundering.
* **Risk Syndication:** Dominant "spiders" (major investors/firms) often aim to appear as anti-corrupters or greasers. They achieve this by **syndicating risk** – compensating other agents (usually locals) to carry out the more illicit work on their behalf.

## Chapter 4: Tax Strategies of Global Elites

* **Tax Evasion vs. Avoidance:** While tax evasion (illegal non-payment) is risky at scale, the focus for sophisticated elites is on **tax avoidance** (legal strategies to minimize tax).
* **Complex Practices:** Tax professionals employ complicated practices like "round-tripping" (routing money through various jurisdictions) and "transfer pricing" (setting prices for goods/services exchanged between entities within the same multinational firm to shift profits to lower-tax jurisdictions).
* **Local Connections:** These strategies are deeply intertwined with local connections. Navigating complex local tax regulations (e.g., in Vietnam) and avoiding unexpected tax bills requires strong local knowledge and networks.

## Chapter 5: Impunity and Stealth Wealth

This chapter explores how UHNWIs maintain anonymity and operate with impunity.

* **Complex Structures & Fall Guys:** They use very complicated legal and financial structures to obscure ownership and control. A key element is the use of "fall guys" or nominees.
    * **Example:** An individual named "Will" (a pseudonym, presumably) who was behind entities involved in an ICJ (International Court of Justice, or similar international tribunal) case did not appear himself. Only the names of intermediaries, entities, and some officers were listed. He reportedly takes pride in his lack of direct, public involvement. In such cases, individuals like "Will" have others (the "fall guys") who take the public exposure and legal risks.
* **Ease of Setting Up Opaque Structures:** Such structures are surprisingly easy and cheap to set up.
    * **Example:** A Hong Kong office could set up a bank account offering complete privacy, including the appointment of a professional (nominee) Director and Shareholder independent of the ultimate beneficial owner, for as little as US$900. Fictitious company names like "Lucky Store 7 Happy" testify to the sheer number of such entities created to serve as fronts or fall guys, often in return for hefty compensation for shouldering the risk.
* **Lack of Accountability:** There's often little incentive or ability for authorities to trace the entire complex structure back to the ultimate beneficiary.
    * **Example:** The 1MDB scandal is cited as a case involving a vast international network of complicity where no single key individual was ultimately punished, and many were able to retain anonymity.

## Moral Dilemmas and Justifications

Individuals involved in these activities employ various justifications for their actions:

1.  **"Gentlemen vs. Cavemen" Mentality:** Christopher (presumably an interviewee or another researcher Hoang cites) notes a distinction: one has moral obligations towards "gentlemen" (peers, other elites) but fewer towards "cavemen" (locals in frontier markets). Part of their skill is navigating social relations between wealthy investors and these "cavemen."
2.  **Familial Sacrifice:** Actions are often justified as being for the ultimate benefit and sustenance of their family.
3.  **"Best Interest is the Name of the Game":** A pragmatic justification that abdicates personal moral responsibility, framing actions as simply playing the game as it's meant to be played.

## Chapter 7: Outcomes – Winners, Losers, and Discontent

The outcomes for those involved in spiderweb capitalism are varied, but rarely straightforwardly positive:

* **Uneven Success:** Some achieve immense success, while others experience "longed exits," often losing all their money.
* **Shared Unhappiness:** Both winners and losers often seem unhappy and unfulfilled.
    * **Winners:** Are forced to hide their wealth, unable to trust anyone (not even family). They experience an endless drive and ambition for the "next thing."
    * **Losers (the "Salmon Ones"):** Can become trapped in precarious business structures, completely reliant on governments that might pull support, or dependent on local accountants they hired.
* **Isolation:**
    * Winners often find they cannot talk about their experiences with anyone.
    * Losers find that their closest confidants through these difficult experiences become the lawyers and advisors involved in the deals, highlighting a transactional and isolated existence.
