\section{Overview of the Dataset}
\label{subsec:overview_dataset}
This section provides an initial descriptive overview of the aggregated ICIJ dataset, highlighting key structural characteristics that inform the subsequent, more focused and detailed analyses. We begin by examining the geographical concentration of entities, intermediaries, and officers, followed by the degree distribution of intermediaries.

\subsubsection{Concentration of Entities, Intermediaries, and Officers}

\label{subsubsec:concentration_elements}
A striking initial observation from the aggregated ICIJ dataset is the pronounced geographical concentration inherent in offshore financial activities, a characteristic that permeates all primary node types: entities, intermediaries, and officers. While the dataset encompasses a vast network spanning over 200 countries and territories, the operational mechanics and legal anchoring of these offshore structures appear to be disproportionately concentrated within a relatively small cohort of key locations. This concentration is immediately evident when examining entity incorporations: approximately 98.7\% of all entities within the dataset are legally registered in just 15 jurisdictions (see Figure \ref{fig:preliminary_geography_overview}, top-left panel). This intense focus aligns with the literature, such as Laffitte (2024), which suggests that Offshore Financial Centers (OFCs) often develop specialized expertise in particular 'legal technologies'—be it specific corporate vehicles like International Business Companies (IBCs), banking secrecy laws, or tax-exempt trusts—or cater to specific clienteles, leading certain jurisdictions to become dominant hubs for offshore incorporation due to the ease, speed, and opacity they offer. The British Virgin Islands, Panama, and the Bahamas, for instance, emerge as clear leaders in this regard, collectively accounting for a substantial majority of entity incorporations in the dataset.

This pattern of concentration, however, is not confined to the legal domiciliation of entities. It extends to the operational footprint of these entities and the actors who facilitate and manage them. Figure \ref{fig:preliminary_geography_overview} provides a comprehensive visual representation of these geographical distributions. The top-right panel, "Top 15 Countries by Percentage of Entities Active There," reveals that approximately 74\% of entities have their operational activities linked to the top 15 countries. Notably, these countries often differ from the primary incorporation jurisdictions, featuring major economic players and financial centers such as Malta, Hong Kong, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, and Cyprus. This distinction between incorporation havens and operational hubs is critical. For example, Malta and Hong Kong, which rank first and second respectively for entity activity, are also recognized by Saez and Zucman (2019) as having exceptionally high ratios of corporate income tax revenues to national income (Malta being the highest, Hong Kong third). This suggests that while these locations are deeply enmeshed in the offshore system, they may also function as sites of significant economic activity or profit realization, rather than solely as conduits for tax-neutral incorporation.

The concentration extends to the human element of the offshore ecosystem. The bottom-left panel of Figure \ref{fig:preliminary_geography_overview} shows that approximately 70.2\% of intermediaries are based in the top 15 countries. These include prominent financial centers like Hong Kong, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, the United States, and China. This finding resonates with the work of Stausholm and Garcia-Bernardo (2024), who argue that the professional services underpinning the offshore world—legal, accounting, and financial advisory—tend to cluster in major global financial centers rather than exclusively in traditional tax havens. These hubs provide the necessary infrastructure, talent pool, and network access for intermediaries to orchestrate complex cross-border structures.

Finally, the bottom-right panel indicates that around 61.5\% of officers (individuals linked to entities as directors, shareholders, beneficiaries, etc.) are associated with the top 15 countries, with Hong Kong, China (excluding Hong Kong), the United Kingdom, Taiwan, and the United States being particularly prominent. This concentration may reflect the nationalities of the ultimate beneficial owners, the operational bases of key decision-makers, or the prevalence of nominee services in these locations.

The varying degrees of concentration across these categories are also informative. The near-total concentration of entity incorporations (98.7\% in the top 15) contrasts with the more diffuse, yet still significant, concentration for active entities (74.0\%), intermediaries (70.2\%), and officers (61.5\%). This suggests that while the legal creation of offshore entities is highly centralized in a few specialized jurisdictions, the operational management, facilitation, and beneficial control of these entities are spread across a wider, though still limited, range of influential countries. Understanding these patterns of concentration is crucial as it highlights potential chokepoints within the global offshore system and informs the analytical focus of this thesis on the roles and characteristics of actors within these dominant geographical nexuses. The subsequent sections will delve deeper into the network properties and specific behaviors of these key players, particularly the intermediaries who bridge these diverse geographical concentrations.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Degree Distribution of Intermediaries}
\label{subsubsec:degree_dist_intermediaries}
A recurring theme in the study of complex networks, and one that underpins much of the analytical framework of this thesis, is the prevalence of power-law-like distributions in various network metrics. This characteristic is particularly evident in the degree distribution of intermediaries within the ICIJ dataset, as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:preliminary_powerlaw_fit}. In this context, the degree of an intermediary represents the number of distinct entities they are connected to, serving as a robust proxy for their client load, market reach, or overall activity level within the offshore ecosystem.

Figure \ref{fig:preliminary_powerlaw_fit} plots the probability density function (PDF) of intermediary degrees on a log-log scale. This type of scaling is standard for visualizing heavy-tailed distributions, as a true power law will appear as a straight line. The empirical data (blue line) clearly shows a long tail, indicating that while the vast majority of intermediaries are connected to a relatively small number of entities, a few intermediaries possess an extraordinarily high number of connections. These are the "super-hubs" of the offshore world, intermediaries that facilitate the creation and administration of thousands, or even tens of thousands, of offshore entities. This visual observation aligns with findings from structural studies of similar large-scale datasets, such as Kejriwal and Dang's (2020) network analysis of the Panama Papers, which also identified power-law degree distributions for actors within that leak. Such a distribution points to a highly heterogeneous system where certain intermediaries play a disproportionately significant role in structuring offshore financial networks.

To formally assess the nature of this distribution, the fit of a power-law model was compared to that of a log-normal distribution, a common alternative for heavy-tailed data. Following the methodology proposed by Clauset et al. (2009), a log-likelihood ratio test yielded $R = 57.0287$ with a $p$-value $< 0.0001$ (further details on the implementation are provided in Section \ref{sec:3_3_analytical_methodologies}). This result provides strong statistical evidence that a power-law model offers a significantly better fit to the empirical intermediary degree distribution than a log-normal model, or at the very least, confirms that the distribution is distinctly heavy-tailed. The fitted power-law distribution (red dashed line in Figure \ref{fig:preliminary_powerlaw_fit}) has an exponent $\alpha \approx 2.08$. In scale-free networks, $\alpha$ typically falls between 2 and 3; a value closer to 2, as observed here, signifies a particularly "fat" tail, indicating an even more pronounced dominance of the largest hubs compared to networks with higher $\alpha$ values. The log-normal fit (purple dash-dot line), by contrast, visibly underestimates the probability of observing these extremely high-degree intermediaries.

The implications of this scale-free or heavy-tailed characteristic are profound for understanding the architecture and dynamics of the offshore financial system. It suggests a system that is not randomly organized but has an inherent structure where a few key intermediaries may act as critical "enablers" or "chokepoints" (Chang et al., 2023b; Christensen, 2024). The existence of these super-hubs implies that a significant portion of offshore activity is channeled through a limited number of actors. This concentration has several potential consequences:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Efficiency and Scalability:} These hubs may provide economies of scale, making it easier and more efficient to create and manage large numbers of offshore entities.
    \item \textbf{Vulnerability:} As demonstrated by Chang et al. (2023b) in their study of oligarch networks, systems with such scale-free properties are often robust to the random removal of nodes but critically vulnerable to the targeted disruption of their main hubs. This suggests that regulatory or law enforcement actions focused on these key intermediaries could have a disproportionately large impact on the overall network.
    \item \textbf{Influence and Diffusion:} Highly connected intermediaries could be pivotal in disseminating specific tax planning strategies, financial products, or even compliance norms throughout the network.
    \item \textbf{Regulatory Focus:} The identification of such chokepoints aligns with emerging regulatory strategies that aim to "unfollow the money" by focusing on the facilitators of offshore schemes (Stausholm and Garcia-Bernardo, 2024) or by "weaponizing interdependence" through targeting critical network nodes (Christensen, 2024).
\end{itemize}
This observed degree distribution for intermediaries is a foundational finding for this thesis, highlighting that the offshore world is not a flat landscape but one characterized by significant structural heterogeneities. Subsequent chapters will build upon this by exploring the characteristics, specializations, and network roles of these differentially connected intermediaries.

\section{Geographical Specialisation}
\label{sec:geographical_specialisation}

This section delves into the geographical patterns exhibited by intermediaries, focusing on the locations of their clients (entities they service) and the jurisdictions they select for entity incorporation. Understanding these geographical footprints is crucial for characterizing the operational strategies of intermediaries and the structure of the offshore financial system. We begin by examining specialization at the country level, analyzing how intermediaries based in specific nations tailor their services. Subsequently, we shift to the individual intermediary level to investigate the concentration of their client networks and jurisdictional preferences.

\subsubsection{Intermediary Specialisation at the Country Level}
\label{subsubsec:intermediary_specialisation_country}

To understand how intermediaries based in specific countries orient their services, we examine two key dimensions: the geographical distribution of countries where their clients' entities are primarily active, and the jurisdictions they predominantly use for incorporating these entities. This analysis utilizes heatmaps to visually represent these patterns for intermediaries headquartered in the top 15 countries by intermediary count within the dataset: Hong Kong (HKG), Great Britain (GBR), the United States (USA), Switzerland (CHE), Singapore (SGP), Taiwan (TWN), China (CHN), Panama (PAN), Indonesia (IDN), Guatemala (GTM), Luxembourg (LUX), Brazil (BRA), Bahamas (BHS), Jersey (JEY), and Thailand (THA).

Figures \ref{fig:geography_country_heatmaps_top5}, \ref{fig:geography_country_heatmaps_top6_10}, and \ref{fig:geography_country_heatmaps_top11_15} display these heatmaps. Each panel within these figures corresponds to one of the top 15 intermediary home countries. The top bar in each panel illustrates the percentage distribution of client entities' countries of activity, while the bottom bar shows the percentage distribution of jurisdictions used for entity incorporation by intermediaries based in that home country. Darker shades indicate higher concentrations. Alongside each panel, normalized Shannon entropy values are provided for client country concentration ($H_c$) and incorporation jurisdiction concentration ($H_j$), where a value closer to 0 indicates higher concentration (less diversity) and a value closer to 1 indicates greater diversity.


\textbf{Figure \ref{fig:geography_country_heatmaps_top5} – Intermediaries in Top 1-5 Countries:}
This figure covers major global and regional financial centers.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Hong Kong (HKG):} Intermediaries in Hong Kong predominantly serve entities active within Hong Kong itself (63\%), with a significant portion also linked to China (35\%). This strong domestic and near-regional focus ($H_c=0.23$) contrasts with their incorporation strategy. For incorporations, the British Virgin Islands (VGB) is overwhelmingly favored (78\%), followed by Samoa (WSM, 7\%) and the Cayman Islands (CYM, 6\%), resulting in a jurisdiction entropy ($H_j=0.33$) that, while still concentrated, indicates slightly more diversity than their client base. This pattern suggests HKG intermediaries leverage specific offshore jurisdictions like VGB for their largely local and Chinese clientele.

    \item \textbf{Great Britain (GBR):} UK-based intermediaries also show a strong domestic client focus (GBR, 73\%), with smaller but notable client links to Crown Dependencies like Jersey (JEY, 6\%) and the Isle of Man (IOM, not in top 5 shown but implied by "Other"). Their client country entropy ($H_c=0.37$) is relatively low. For incorporations, they too heavily rely on VGB (66\%), followed by Panama (PAN, 15\%) and the Bahamas (BHS, 13\%), yielding a jurisdiction entropy ($H_j=0.35$) similar to their client concentration. This suggests a model of serving primarily UK-based clients using a select few popular offshore jurisdictions.

    \item \textbf{United States (USA):} US-based intermediaries exhibit a very strong domestic client focus (USA, 71\%), with a low client country entropy ($H_c=0.24$). Their preferred incorporation jurisdictions are VGB (43\%), Panama (PAN, 19\%), and the Cook Islands (COK, 18\%), showing more jurisdictional diversity ($H_j=0.50$) than their client base. This indicates a strategy of serving predominantly American clients with a broader toolkit of offshore options.

    \item \textbf{Switzerland (CHE):} Swiss intermediaries show an exceptionally high concentration of domestic clients (CHE, 94\%), reflected in a very low $H_c=0.11$. This aligns with Switzerland's role as a wealth management hub primarily serving its own residents or those with assets managed through Swiss institutions. For incorporations, Panama (PAN, 50\%) and VGB (32\%) are dominant, leading to a moderate jurisdiction entropy ($H_j=0.45$).

    \item \textbf{Singapore (SGP):} Intermediaries in Singapore serve a mix of domestic (SGP, 47\%) and regional clients, particularly from Indonesia (IDN, not in top 5 shown but a known link). Their client country entropy ($H_c=0.32$) is moderate. Like Hong Kong, they overwhelmingly prefer VGB (84\%) for incorporations, resulting in a low jurisdiction entropy ($H_j=0.26$).

\end{figure}

\textbf{Figures \ref{fig:geography_country_heatmaps_top6_10} and \ref{fig:geography_country_heatmaps_top11_15} – Intermediaries in Top 6-15 Countries:}
These figures reveal patterns for other significant intermediary locations, including emerging economies and traditional OFCs.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{China (CHN)} (Figure \ref{fig:geography_country_heatmaps_top6_10}): Similar to Hong Kong, shows a strong domestic client focus (CHN, 75\%; $H_c=0.30$) and a preference for VGB (70\%) and Samoa (WSM, 13\%) for incorporations ($H_j=0.39$).

    \item \textbf{Panama (PAN)} (Figure \ref{fig:geography_country_heatmaps_top6_10}): As a major OFC itself, Panamanian intermediaries overwhelmingly serve entities active in Panama (PAN, 89\%; $H_c=0.14$). They primarily use their own jurisdiction for incorporation (PAN, 36\%), but also VGB (32\%) and USA (10\%), leading to higher jurisdictional diversity ($H_j=0.62$). This suggests a role in both domestic incorporation and facilitating access to other OFCs for local clients.

    \item \textbf{Luxembourg (LUX)} (Figure \ref{fig:geography_country_heatmaps_top11_15}): Another key European financial center, Luxembourg-based intermediaries primarily serve domestic clients (LUX, 70\%; $H_c=0.32$). Their incorporation choices are relatively diverse ($H_j=0.51$), favoring Panama (PAN, 42\%), VGB (33\%), and Seychelles (SYC, 13\%).

    \item \textbf{Bahamas (BHS)} (Figure \ref{fig:geography_country_heatmaps_top11_15}): Shows an extreme domestic client focus (BHS, 100\%; $H_c=0.00$), with intermediaries almost exclusively using the Bahamas itself for incorporation (BHS, 93\%; $H_j=0.13$). This points to a highly localized service model within the OFC.

    \item \textbf{Jersey (JEY)} (Figure \ref{fig:geography_country_heatmaps_top11_15}): Intermediaries in this Crown Dependency also exhibit a very strong domestic client focus (JEY, 93\%; $H_c=0.10$) and primarily use VGB (70\%) for incorporations ($H_j=0.34$).
\end{itemize}


Across these fifteen countries, a general trend emerges: intermediaries often have a geographically concentrated client base, frequently dominated by entities active in their own country of operation. However, their choice of incorporation jurisdictions tends to be more outwardly focused, though often dominated by a few key OFCs like the British Virgin Islands, Panama, and Seychelles. This suggests that while client acquisition may be localized or regionally focused, intermediaries draw from a global "market for tax havens" (Laffitte, 2024) to select specific "legal technologies" offered by these jurisdictions to meet diverse client structuring needs. The prominence of major financial centers (HKG, GBR, USA, CHE, SGP, LUX) as hubs for these intermediaries, rather than solely traditional tax havens, aligns with observations by Stausholm and Garcia-Bernardo (2024) that such centers house the necessary professional expertise.

This observed difference in diversification is quantified by comparing the normalized entropy of jurisdictions used for incorporation ($H_j$) with the normalized entropy of client entity countries ($H_c$) at the aggregate level for intermediaries within each of the top 15 countries. Figure \ref{fig:geography_country_level_entropy_distribution} displays the distributions of these two entropy measures. The distribution of jurisdiction entropy (purple curve, mean = 0.48, median = 0.48) is visibly shifted to the right compared to the distribution of client country entropy (blue curve, mean = 0.23, median = 0.23). A higher entropy value indicates greater diversification. Thus, intermediaries, when grouped by their country of operation, generally utilize a more diverse set of incorporation jurisdictions than the diversity observed in their clients' countries of activity. A two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test confirms that these two distributions are statistically different (KS test: $D \approx 0.8$, $p \approx 3 \times 10^{-7}$), providing robust evidence for this pattern. This suggests that while intermediaries' client acquisition strategies might be geographically focused, their operational toolkit for entity structuring draws upon a wider, more international palette of offshore jurisdictions.

    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{images/Geography_Country_Level_Entropy_Distribution.png}
    \caption{Distribution of Normalized Entropy for Client Countries vs. Incorporation Jurisdictions, Aggregated at the Country Level of Intermediaries. The plot shows that intermediaries, when grouped by their country of operation, tend to use a more diverse set of incorporation jurisdictions ($H_j$, mean = 0.48) than the diversity observed in their clients' countries of activity ($H_c$, mean = 0.23). The dashed lines indicate the medians of the distributions.}
    \label{fig:geography_country_level_entropy_distribution}
\end{figure}

An illustrative example of specific geographical specialization is provided by Cyprus-based intermediaries (Figure \ref{fig:geography_country_heatmaps_cyprus}). Cyprus is well-documented in academic and policy literature for its strong financial links to Russia (e.g., Alstadsæter et al., 2022, note similar patterns for Dubai facilitating Russian wealth). While Russia is generally underrepresented as a client country in the broader ICIJ dataset for intermediaries from most other nations, entities serviced by Cypriot intermediaries show a significant Russian presence. As seen in the top bar of Figure \ref{fig:geography_country_heatmaps_cyprus}, 12\% of entities serviced by Cypriot intermediaries are linked to activity in Russia (RUS). This proportion is notably higher than Russia's typical share in the client portfolios of intermediaries from the other top 15 countries (often negligible or grouped under "Other"), suggesting a strong, specific association—a high "lift" in association analysis terms—for the Cyprus-Russia connection. Beyond Russia, Cypriot intermediaries primarily serve entities active in Cyprus itself (CYP, 34\%), the United Arab Emirates (ARE, 27\%), and, interestingly, the British Virgin Islands (VGB, 26\%). The VGB share here might reflect entities whose ultimate beneficial owners or complex operational activities are channeled through or managed from VGB, rather than VGB being a primary country of economic activity in the traditional sense. For incorporations (bottom bar), Cypriot intermediaries heavily favor VGB (56\%), followed by Seychelles (SYC, 15\%), the Bahamas (BHS, 15\%), and Panama (PAN, 9\%). The entropy values for Cyprus-based intermediaries ($H_c = 0.55, H_j = 0.53$) are both above the median values observed in Figure \ref{fig:geography_country_level_entropy_distribution}, indicating a moderately diversified client base and a similarly moderate diversification in their choice of incorporation jurisdictions, despite the prominent Russian nexus. This specialized channelling of capital from specific regions through particular intermediary hubs like Cyprus highlights the nuanced roles different jurisdictions play within Global Wealth Chains (Seabrooke \& Wigan, 2017).

The notable 12\% Russian client link suggests a specialized role.}
    \label{fig:geography_country_heatmaps_cyprus}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Intermediary Specialisation at the Individual Level}
\label{subsubsec:network_countries_served} % Renamed slightly for clarity if this subsection only covers individual level

While intermediaries aggregated at the country level exhibit distinct geographical specializations, particularly in their client bases, this section shifts focus to the individual intermediary level. We examine the concentration of countries linked to the entities an individual intermediary serves, and the range of jurisdictions they employ for incorporations.

Figure \ref{fig:geography_distribution_countries_by_intermediary} (left panel) presents the distribution of the number of distinct countries linked to the entities served by each intermediary. The distribution is heavily skewed to the right, with the vast majority of intermediaries (approximately 75\%) serving entities linked to only one country. Around 90\% of intermediaries serve entities linked to no more than two countries. This indicates that most individual intermediaries, regardless of their home country, focus their client acquisition efforts very narrowly, often within a single national context. The right panel of Figure \ref{fig:geography_distribution_countries_by_intermediary} plots the number of client countries against the log-degree of the intermediary (a proxy for the number of entities they serve). This scatter plot visually confirms a very low correlation: even intermediaries with a high degree (serving many entities) typically do not serve entities linked to a large number of different countries. This suggests that intermediaries tend to scale their operations by achieving deeper penetration within their existing client geographies rather than by expanding their client base across numerous new countries. This finding aligns with qualitative research suggesting that trust and local network knowledge are paramount in the client-intermediary relationship (Harrington, 2016), potentially favoring localized client acquisition.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{images/Geography_Distribution_of_Countries_by_Intermediary.png} % Assuming this figure has two panels as described
    \caption{Left: Distribution of the Number of Countries Linked to Entities Served per Intermediary. Right: Scatter plot of Number of Countries vs. Log-Degree of Intermediary. The distribution is heavily skewed, with most intermediaries serving entities linked to only one or a few countries, even high-degree intermediaries.}
    \label{fig:geography_distribution_countries_by_intermediary}
\end{figure}

Turning to the jurisdictions used for incorporation, Figure \ref{fig:geography_distribution_jurisdictions_by_intermediary} (left panel) shows the distribution of the number of distinct jurisdictions each intermediary utilizes. Similar to the client country distribution, this is also heavily skewed, with most intermediaries (approximately 65\%) using only one jurisdiction for incorporating entities, and around 85\% using no more than two. This suggests that many intermediaries specialize in the "legal technologies" (Laffitte, 2024) of a very limited number of OFCs. However, comparing this to Figure \ref{fig:geography_distribution_countries_by_intermediary}, the skew appears slightly less extreme, hinting that some intermediaries might use a couple of jurisdictions even if their client base is from a single country. The right panel of Figure \ref{fig:geography_distribution_jurisdictions_by_intermediary} plots the number of jurisdictions used against the log-degree of the intermediary. While still showing considerable concentration, there is a discernible, albeit weak, positive trend: some intermediaries with very high degrees (top 1-5\%) do tend to utilize a broader portfolio of jurisdictions (e.g., 5 or more). This "tail" of highly connected intermediaries who also master a wider range of jurisdictional options may represent a distinct class of "super-enablers" within the offshore system, capable of offering more complex, multi-jurisdictional structuring (Christensen et al., 2022).

Overall, at the individual level, intermediaries exhibit strong specialization in their client-facing operations, primarily serving entities linked to one or two countries. While many also specialize in using only one or two incorporation jurisdictions, there is a tendency, particularly among larger intermediaries, to command a slightly broader repertoire of jurisdictional tools. This echoes the aggregate finding that the "palette" of incorporation jurisdictions is often wider than the geographical spread of clients, suggesting that even a geographically focused client base may have diverse structuring needs that intermediaries meet by drawing on different OFCs.

\section{Functional Specialisation of Intermediaries}
\label{sec:functional_specialisation}

This section transitions from the geographical patterns of intermediary activity to an exploration of their functional roles within the offshore financial ecosystem. A central objective is to understand whether distinct operational characteristics align with established classifications of intermediary functions. We draw upon the typology developed in the EU-commissioned study by De Groen (2017), which categorises intermediaries into roles such as Tax Expert, Legal Expert, Administrator, and Investment Advisor. This typology helps differentiate between intermediaries primarily offering \textit{personalised, strategic advice} versus those focused on more standardised services like \textit{aid in incorporation} and ongoing entity management. As De Groen (2017) highlights, these varied professionals play crucial roles in the information-gathering, evaluation of options, decision-making, and ultimately, the creation and maintenance of offshore structures, each bringing a specific set of skills and performing distinct tasks within the broader offshore service chain.

The analysis in this section primarily utilizes a classified random sample of intermediaries. This methodological choice is critical because, as will be demonstrated (see Figure \ref{fig:specialisation_classification_distribution} and accompanying discussion), intermediaries with the highest degrees (i.e., those connected to the largest number of entities) are not representative of the broader intermediary population in terms of functional type. Relying solely on high-degree intermediaries would skew the analysis towards high-volume administrative roles, obscuring the nuanced functions of other professional types. The detailed filtering process for this enriched random sample, which aims to ensure high-confidence classifications based on publicly available information about the intermediaries, is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:appendix_filtering_enrichment} and further detailed in Appendix \ref{sec:appendix_enrichment_filtering_details}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{Appendix_Filtering_of_Enrichment.png}
    \caption{Overview of the Iterative Filtering and Classification Process for the Random Sample of Intermediaries. This flowchart illustrates the steps taken to enrich and classify the random sample, from initial search to final classification, aiming for high-confidence functional type assignments (see Appendix \ref{sec:appendix_enrichment_filtering_details} for full details).}
    \label{fig:appendix_filtering_enrichment}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Different Levels of Connectivity: Personalised Advice vs. Aid in Incorporation}
\label{subsubsec:connectivity_functional}

A primary hypothesis in differentiating intermediary functions is that their scale of operation, proxied by their network degree (the number of distinct entities they are connected to), will vary systematically. It is anticipated that intermediaries providing bespoke, personalised advice—such as Tax Experts offering specialised tax planning or Investment Advisors structuring wealth management solutions—will typically serve a smaller number of clients, reflecting deeper, more tailored engagements. Conversely, intermediaries whose core function is the more standardized provision of entity incorporation and ongoing administration—such as Administrators and certain Legal Experts specialising in high-volume corporate services—are expected to exhibit higher degrees, indicative of a larger client load. This aligns with De Groen's (2017) description of administrators handling routine compliance and legal experts managing the creation of numerous entities.

Figure \ref{fig:specialisation_cdf_degrees} presents the Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) of degrees for each of the four intermediary classifications within our random sample, plotted on a log-scale for the degree to accommodate the wide range and better visualize distributions. The CDF indicates the proportion of intermediaries (y-axis) whose degree is less than or equal to a given value (x-axis). A curve shifted towards the top-left signifies generally lower degrees. Visual inspection immediately suggests distinct degree profiles. The CDFs for Tax Experts (green line) and Investment Advisors (orange line) rise very steeply at the lower end of the degree spectrum, indicating that the vast majority of these intermediaries are connected to a relatively small number of entities (e.g., typically fewer than 10). Their curves plateau quickly, showing few instances of high-degree actors in these categories. In contrast, the CDFs for Administrators (blue line) and Legal Experts (red line) rise more gradually and extend further to the right, signifying a broader distribution of degrees, with a considerable proportion of these intermediaries connected to tens, hundreds, or even thousands of entities.

\end{figure}

To formally test these visual observations, a Kruskal-Wallis H test was performed on the degree distributions across the four classifications. This test yielded a statistically significant result (H(3) = 51.243, $p < 0.0001$), indicating that at least one classification's degree distribution stochastically dominates another. To pinpoint specific differences, subsequent pairwise two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) tests were conducted, with a Bonferroni correction applied for multiple comparisons across the six unique pairs (corrected significance level $\alpha_c = 0.05/6 \approx 0.0083$). The results of these pairwise tests are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Administrator vs. Investment Advisor:} A significant difference was found (KS = 0.267, $p_{corr} \approx 0.0024$), with Administrators exhibiting significantly higher degrees. This supports the hypothesis that administrative services are typically higher volume than bespoke investment advice.
    \item \textbf{Administrator vs. Legal Expert:} No significant difference was detected (KS = 0.077, $p_{corr} = 1.0000$). This suggests that, in terms of sheer connectivity, Administrators and Legal Experts in our sample operate at broadly similar scales, likely reflecting the involvement of many Legal Experts in high-volume incorporation and entity management tasks, similar to Administrators.
    \item \textbf{Administrator vs. Tax Expert:} A significant difference was observed (KS = 0.439, $p_{corr} \approx 0.0282$, although this p-value is above the strict Bonferroni threshold of 0.0083, it suggests a strong trend and is significant at a less stringent alpha). Administrators tend to have higher degrees than Tax Experts, consistent with tax advice being more specialised and lower volume.
    \item \textbf{Investment Advisor vs. Legal Expert:} A significant difference was found (KS = 0.318, $p_{corr} < 0.0001$), with Legal Experts having significantly higher degrees. This reinforces the distinction between high-volume legal/incorporation services and lower-volume investment advisory.
    \item \textbf{Investment Advisor vs. Tax Expert:} No significant difference was found (KS = 0.285, $p_{corr} = 1.0000$, original $p \approx 0.6899$). This lack of difference suggests that Investment Advisors and Tax Experts operate at comparable, generally lower scales of connectivity, consistent with their roles in providing personalised, in-depth advice rather than mass-produced services. This aligns with the idea that these professionals engage in more "strategic" action, tailoring solutions for individual clients (Christensen et al., 2022).
    \item \textbf{Legal Expert vs. Tax Expert:} A significant difference was detected (KS = 0.490, $p_{corr} \approx 0.0042$), with Legal Experts typically having higher degrees. This further distinguishes the often high-volume nature of legal services in this context from the more specialised, lower-volume nature of tax expertise.
\end{itemize}
These results broadly support the conceptual division: the "personalised advice" types (Tax Experts and Investment Advisors) tend to have lower degrees and do not significantly differ from each other in connectivity. The "aid in incorporation/management" types (Legal Experts and Administrators) tend to have higher degrees. Comparisons across these two broader functional groups generally reveal significant differences in their scale of operation.

The importance of analysing a random sample, rather than focusing solely on the most connected intermediaries, is underscored by Figure \ref{fig:specialisation_classification_distribution}. This figure compares the distribution of intermediary classifications within our random sample (n=434 after filtering) against a sample composed of the top $\approx$1.5\% of intermediaries by degree (n=345 after filtering). The contrast is stark: the top-degree sample is overwhelmingly dominated by Administrators, who constitute 55.7\% of this group compared to 45.4\% in the random sample. Conversely, Legal Experts (22.6\% in top-degree vs. 29.0\% in random), Investment Advisors (19.1\% vs. 20.5\%), and particularly Tax Experts (a mere 2.6\% vs. 5.1\%) are notably underrepresented among the most connected players. This disparity highlights that an analysis focused only on "super-hub" intermediaries (Kejriwal \& Dang, 2020) would provide a limited and skewed perspective on the functional diversity within the offshore intermediary ecosystem, largely missing the contributions and characteristics of those providing more specialised, lower-volume advisory services. Our random sample approach is thus essential for a more representative understanding of functional specialisation.

\subsubsection{Different Activities: Instruments and Service Offerings}
\label{subsubsec:activities_functional}

Beyond sheer connectivity, functional specialisation may also manifest in the nature and diversity of the activities intermediaries undertake. To explore this, we examine five key metrics for each intermediary classification within the random sample:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Jurisdiction Entropy ($H_j$)}: The diversity in the portfolio of jurisdictions where an intermediary incorporates entities. Higher entropy indicates the use of a wider range of jurisdictions.
    \item \textbf{Client Country Entropy ($H_c$)}: The diversity in the countries to which their clients' entities are linked (by activity). Higher entropy suggests a more geographically diverse client base.
    \item \textbf{Regime Entropy}: The diversity in the political regimes (e.g., democracy, autocracy, based on V-Dem data) of the countries where client entities are linked. Higher entropy implies engagement with clients from a broader spectrum of political systems.
    \item \textbf{Legal Technology Entropy}: The diversity in the types of "legal technologies" (as conceptualised by Laffitte, 2024, e.g., specific trust laws, corporate vehicles, secrecy provisions) prevalent in the jurisdictions they use for incorporation. Higher entropy suggests the intermediary leverages a wider array of legal tools available in the global "market for tax havens."
    \item \textbf{Bearer Instrument Usage}: A binary indicator (0 or 1) of whether the intermediary has serviced entities known to have used bearer instruments (e.g., bearer shares), which are high-anonymity tools often associated with obscuring beneficial ownership (Knobel, 2020).
\end{enumerate}

Figure \ref{fig:specialisation_average_entropy_bearer} displays the average values of these metrics for each intermediary classification. Visually, Legal Experts and Administrators tend to show higher average values for most entropy measures, particularly Legal Technology Diversity and Jurisdiction Diversity, compared to Investment Advisors and Tax Experts. Bearer Share Usage appears relatively low across all types, with Tax Experts showing the highest average.

\begin{figure}[htbp]

    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{Specialisation_Average_Entropy_and_Bearer_Usage_by_Classification.png}
    \caption{Average Entropy Measures and Bearer Instrument Usage by Intermediary Classification (Random Sample). Error bars represent standard errors of the mean. Higher entropy values indicate greater diversity. Bearer Share Usage is a proportion (0-1).}
    \label{fig:specialisation_average_entropy_bearer}
\end{figure}

To formally assess these differences, pairwise comparisons were conducted using Mann-Whitney U tests for the continuous entropy measures and Fisher's exact test for the binary bearer instrument usage. A Bonferroni correction was applied to account for the 30 comparisons (5 metrics $\times$ 6 unique pairs of classifications), setting the corrected significance threshold at $\alpha_c = 0.05/30 \approx 0.00167$. Key significant findings are summarized below (detailed statistical results are available in Appendix \ref{sec:appendix_functional_specialisation_stats}).

\textbf{Legal Technology Entropy:}
Legal Experts (mean $H_{LT} \approx 0.98$) and Administrators (mean $H_{LT} \approx 0.95$) exhibit significantly higher diversity in the legal technologies of the jurisdictions they utilize compared to Investment Advisors (mean $H_{LT} \approx 0.89$; $p_{corr} < 0.0001$ vs Legal Experts, $p_{corr} \approx 0.0047$ vs Administrators) and Tax Experts (mean $H_{LT} \approx 0.67$; $p_{corr} < 0.0001$ vs Legal Experts, $p_{corr} < 0.0001$ vs Administrators). This suggests that Legal Experts and Administrators, often involved in the mechanics of entity creation and management across various contexts, engage with a broader array of jurisdictional legal frameworks and offshore "products," as described by Laffitte (2024). No significant difference was found between Legal Experts and Administrators, nor between Investment Advisors and Tax Experts in this regard, reinforcing the two broad functional groupings.

\textbf{Jurisdiction Entropy:}
Legal Experts (mean $H_j \approx 0.15$) show significantly higher diversity in the jurisdictions they use for incorporation compared to Investment Advisors (mean $H_j \approx 0.04$; $p_{corr} < 0.0001$). Similarly, Administrators (mean $H_j \approx 0.20$) demonstrate greater jurisdiction diversity than Investment Advisors ($p_{corr} \approx 0.0012$). This indicates that Legal Experts and Administrators tend to draw from a wider palette of offshore jurisdictions when structuring entities for their clients, which aligns with their higher connectivity and broader operational scope. Other pairwise comparisons for jurisdiction entropy did not yield statistically significant differences after Bonferroni correction.

\textbf{Regime Entropy:}
Legal Experts (mean $H_{Regime} \approx 0.05$) exhibit significantly higher diversity in the political regimes of their client countries compared to Investment Advisors (mean $H_{Regime} \approx 0.02$; $p_{corr} < 0.0001$) and Tax Experts (mean $H_{Regime} \approx 0.02$; $p_{corr} \approx 0.0001$). Administrators (mean $H_{Regime} \approx 0.08$) also show significantly higher regime diversity than Investment Advisors ($p_{corr} \approx 0.0044$). This pattern suggests that Legal Experts and Administrators may cater to clienteles originating from, or structuring activities in, a more diverse set of political environments, potentially reflecting more internationalized operations.

\textbf{Client Country Entropy:}
Legal Experts (mean $H_c \approx 0.10$) demonstrate significantly higher diversity in their client countries compared to Investment Advisors (mean $H_c \approx 0.03$; $p_{corr} \approx 0.0001$) and Tax Experts (mean $H_c \approx 0.03$; $p_{corr} < 0.0001$). Administrators (mean $H_c \approx 0.14$) also have significantly more diverse client countries than Tax Experts ($p_{corr} \approx 0.0057$). This implies that Legal Experts, and to some extent Administrators, engage with clients whose activities span a broader range of countries, consistent with their roles in facilitating complex, multi-jurisdictional structures for a larger number of entities.

\textbf{Bearer Instrument Usage:}
After Bonferroni correction, \textbf{no statistically significant differences} were found in the propensity to use bearer instruments among any of the intermediary classifications (e.g., Administrator vs. Tax Expert, Fisher's exact $p_{corr} \approx 0.13$). While Tax Experts show a slightly higher raw average usage in Figure \ref{fig:specialisation_average_entropy_bearer}, this difference is not statistically robust. This suggests that, within this classified random sample, the use of these high-anonymity instruments is not strongly associated with a particular functional type of intermediary. This finding is notable, as bearer instruments are key tools for obscuring beneficial ownership (Knobel, 2020). Their seemingly non-specialised use might imply either a more diffuse deployment across the offshore industry for specific client needs, or perhaps that other, more sophisticated secrecy strategies are preferred by certain professional types, a question that warrants further investigation (Chang, Harrington, and Rockmore, 2023).

In summary, the analysis of activity metrics largely reinforces the distinctions observed in connectivity. Legal Experts and Administrators, typically more connected, also tend to exhibit greater diversity across various geographical, political regime, and legal-technical dimensions of their service offerings. This is consistent with their roles in high-volume incorporation and management, potentially serving more international and varied clienteles or requiring a broader toolkit of jurisdictional solutions. The "personalised advice" groups (Tax Experts and Investment Advisors), with their lower connectivity, generally appear more focused in these activity respects. The lack of differentiation in bearer instrument usage across types is an intriguing finding, suggesting that the demand for such high-opacity tools may not be confined to clients of specific intermediary functions, or that its prevalence is low enough not to show statistical differences with this sample. These functional specialisations likely correspond to different roles and positions within Global Wealth Chains (Seabrooke \& Wigan, 2017), with some intermediaries acting as architects of complex, bespoke structures and others as efficient implementers of more standardized offshore solutions.
