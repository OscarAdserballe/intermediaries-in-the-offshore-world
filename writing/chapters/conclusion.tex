This thesis covered an exploration of the often-shadowy world of offshore finance, not by chasing the beneficiaries, but by focusing on its architects: the intermediaries. We sought to understand how these crucial enablers specialize, asking \textit{how} they carve out their niches in a system that thrives on complexity and opacity. 

The core contention – that intermediaries exhibit significant geographical and functional specialization – finds robust support in the analysis. Geographically, many intermediaries are "local anchors with a global reach," deeply embedded in specific national or regional client markets, yet adept at navigating the global "supermarket" of offshore jurisdictions and their varied "legal technologies." This duality is key to their value proposition. Functionally, the data sketches distinct profiles: the high-volume "commoditizers" like many Administrators and Legal Experts, building broad infrastructures of entities, stand in contrast to the more bespoke "customizers" like Tax Experts and Investment Advisors, who offer tailored, often lower-volume, strategic counsel. These are not merely descriptive categories; they point to different operational logics, different scales of connectivity, and potentially different vulnerabilities.

The implications for those engaged in the "race" against tax avoidance are considerable. If intermediaries are indeed locally anchored, national regulators may possess more direct leverage than often perceived, offering a route to bypass the multi-level game of international tax governance. Furthermore, recognizing functional differentiation allows for more nuanced regulatory strategies - perhaps layered liability or tailored due diligence - rather than a one-size-fits-all approach.
