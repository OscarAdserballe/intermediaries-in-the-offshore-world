* Overall approach from neoclassical public finance and economics. Lectures from Zucman's overviews of tax evasion and avoidance in the modern economic literature has been the primary source. https://gabriel-zucman.eu/publicecon/
* Niche within Political Sociology through Brooke Harrington (2016)'s book and the method's employed in her ethnography of wealth managers. Likewise the tentative work in Chang et al. (2023a and 2023b) on network structure. However, for the latter, they concentrate more on demand-strategies rather than the more interesting supply-side strategies that are the focus of this thesis.

The phenomenon of 'escape from the state' through quasi-legal means, sometimes characterized provocatively as a form of 'anarchy for the rich,' presents a significant puzzle within contemporary political economy. Understanding the mechanisms and drivers behind the extensive use of offshore jurisdictions and complex financial structures is crucial. To address this, the present study attempts an interdisciplinary analysis, situated at the intersection of Political Sociology, Public Finance, and International Political Economy (IPE). The intention is to leverage the distinct analytical strengths inherent in each of these fields to provide a more comprehensive perspective.

While adopting an overarching neoclassical framework, this work endeavors to incorporate insights from these related disciplines, translating them where possible into the language and analytical tools commonly employed within neoclassical economics. This approach seeks to bridge theoretical perspectives often treated in isolation.

The central claim advanced throughout this thesis concerns the critical relevance of examining supply-side dynamics within the offshore financial system. Specifically, it argues that the role of intermediaries – the professional enablers and facilitators of offshore activity – is an incredibly relevant, yet often overlooked, factor. Traditional public finance literature, for instance, frequently emphasizes demand-side factors driving the utilization of offshore structures, such as tax rates or regulatory arbitrage opportunities. In contrast, the function and influence of the supply side – encompassing the specialized intermediaries and the specific services offered by various jurisdictions that actively enable and shape offshore activity – remains comparatively under-explored from an empirical standpoint. Building upon recent scholarship that increasingly highlights these supply dynamics (e.g., Laffitte 2024; Alstadsæter et al. 2019), this thesis seeks to extend and potentially generalize insights from qualitative work, such as Harrington's (2016) study of wealth managers, through a quantitative analysis drawing upon the extensive data revealed by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) leaks.

\section{Why Tax Evasion among High-income earners: The Scale and Impact of Individual High-End Tax Evasion (Alstadsæter et al. 2019, Zucman).}

The issue of tax evasion among high-income earners, alongside the closely related phenomenon of tax avoidance, warrants significant attention within contemporary political economy and public finance. While considerable progress has arguably been made in curbing outright tax evasion, tax avoidance remains a substantial challenge, a point emphasized by commentators such as Stiglitz (cited in Alstadsæter et al., 2024 EU report). The persistence of avoidance, particularly among the highest earners, carries significant implications.

Specifically concerning the tax avoidance practices of individual high-income earners, several sub-optimalities and inefficiencies are introduced into the economic system. These include the generation of a distinct class of rents accruing to the intermediaries who facilitate such schemes, the potential for poor allocation of resources as investment decisions are distorted by tax considerations rather than underlying economic merit, and, beyond these economic inefficiencies, a range of normative concerns regarding fairness and the integrity of the tax system that inevitably accompany widespread tax avoidance.

This topic has garnered considerable attention within academia in recent years, partly because it intersects with broader debates on inequality. A crucial distinction often highlighted is between income and wealth inequality. Income inequality can be somewhat ephemeral in nature; high-earners in one year may retire or experience income fluctuations in the next. Wealth, in contrast, tends to be more permanent, potentially distorting social outcomes over non-transient periods in a more meaningful way. Indeed, wealth accumulation is recognized as a critically important determinant of social mobility (as explored in the work of Chetty) and a key driver of overall inequality trends (central to Piketty's analyses). The focus here draws selectively upon the extensive literature concerning wealth, acknowledging the seminal contributions of these economists within the field, while recognizing the vastness of resources available on this subject.

With that said, quantifying the precise behavioral effects of tax evasion and avoidance on incentives – such as the incentives to work, save, or invest – remains a significant empirical challenge. While some studies have examined the effects related to Multinational Corporations (MNCs), often leveraging specific policy changes or contexts (such as the studies concerning Puerto Rico), isolating these effects for individuals proves considerably more difficult. A key complicating factor is the role of expectations; an individual's behavior is likely highly dependent on their expectation of being able to successfully evade or avoid taxes in the future. Obtaining credible quasi-experimental evidence on such expectations and their behavioral consequences is notoriously challenging.

\section{Demand-side limited to understand this phenomenon - game of cat and mouse: Limitations of Traditional Demand-Side Models and Enforcement (Allingham-Sandmo critique, Audit limitations - Alstadsæter et al. 2019).}
\label{sec:1_2}

While the supply-side dynamics involving intermediaries offer a crucial lens for analysis, it is also important to acknowledge the limitations inherent in traditional demand-side approaches when attempting to understand the full scope of tax evasion, particularly at the upper echelons of the income and wealth distributions. Neoclassical public finance, through seminal contributions like the Allingham-Sandmo (1972) model, provides a powerful and often empirically supported framework for understanding tax evasion decisions for the majority of taxpayers. This standard model typically portrays evasion as a rational gamble, where individuals weigh the expected benefits of non-compliance against the probability of detection and the severity of potential penalties.

However, this demand-focused perspective encounters significant difficulties when applied to high-end tax evasion. This specific segment represents a considerable challenge, not only because it constitutes a major source of lost tax revenue but also due to the distinct mechanisms often employed. The standard Allingham-Sandmo framework, for instance, struggles to adequately explain the patterns observed among the wealthiest individuals. Indeed, under standard assumptions about risk aversion and the structure of penalties and audit probabilities, the model often predicts that wealthier individuals, facing potentially higher stakes and scrutiny, should be *less* inclined to evade taxes. Yet, empirical evidence, particularly from studies leveraging leaked data (e.g., Alstadsæter et al. 2019), suggests the opposite: offshore tax evasion appears highly concentrated among the ultra-wealthy.

Furthermore, traditional methods for empirically studying tax compliance, such as random audit studies (e.g., Kleven et al. 2011), also face limitations in capturing the full picture of high-end evasion. As highlighted by Alstadsæter et al. (2019), while random audits are invaluable for understanding compliance behavior regarding income streams typically subject to third-party reporting or easily verifiable through standard audits, they often fail to detect the sophisticated, cross-border evasion strategies frequently utilized by the wealthiest segment. Complex offshore structures, shell corporations, and opaque trust arrangements often fall outside the scope of conventional audit procedures, rendering this form of evasion largely invisible to standard demand-side enforcement tools.

This points towards a dynamic often characterized as a "game of cat and mouse." Demand-side enforcement mechanisms, predicated on detecting and penalizing individual non-compliance, struggle to keep pace with the evolving and increasingly complex strategies developed to obscure wealth and income, often with the assistance of specialized intermediaries. Consequently, relying solely on demand-side models and traditional enforcement metrics provides an incomplete, and potentially misleading, understanding of the phenomenon, especially concerning the significant evasion occurring at the top of the distribution. This underscores the necessity of incorporating supply-side factors and network structures to gain a more comprehensive view.


\section{Supply-side far more relevant to look at: Intermediaries as Gatekeepers (Alstadsæter et al. 2019 model, Harrington 2016).}
\label{sec:1_3}

To fully grasp the dynamics of offshore tax evasion and avoidance, it is crucial to clarify what constitutes the "supply-side" in this context. Here, the supply-side refers specifically to the ecosystem of professional intermediaries – such as law firms, banks, trust companies, and specialized advisors – as well as the jurisdictions that provide the legal and regulatory frameworks enabling offshore financial activities. The central argument advanced in this thesis, building on insights from models like Alstadsæter et al. (2019) and qualitative work such as Harrington (2016), is that this supply-side dimension is far more relevant to scrutinize than often acknowledged, potentially offering more effective avenues for understanding and potentially curbing offshore practices compared to a sole focus on demand-side factors.

A primary reason for emphasizing the supply side relates to the concept of elasticity. It is argued here that the elasticity of supply of intermediaries is considerably higher, and therefore potentially more responsive to policy interventions, compared to the elasticity of demand from clients seeking offshore services. Several factors underpin this view:

First, the incentives structuring the behavior of intermediaries are arguably much more sensitive to changes in the regulatory or reputational environment. For these professionals and firms, the provision of offshore services is not merely an option but often a core component of their business model and career trajectory. Their professional existence and profitability are directly dependent on their continued ability to offer these specific services effectively and discreetly. Consequently, factors that threaten this ability – such as increased regulatory scrutiny, heightened enforcement risk, or significant reputational damage – can have a pronounced impact on their willingness and capacity to supply these services. In contrast, the demand for tax minimization or evasion among potential clients, driven by factors like high tax rates or a desire for secrecy, can be seen as a relatively persistent force. While demand might fluctuate, the fundamental desire among some wealthy individuals and corporations to reduce tax burdens is likely to remain, making demand potentially less elastic to targeted interventions than the specialized supply of enabling services.

Second, the micro-sociological account provided by Harrington (2016) offers compelling reasons why intermediaries are so central. Her ethnographic work illuminates the deeply personal, trust-based relationships that often form between wealth managers and their elite clients. These relationships, built over time and predicated on discretion and expertise, are difficult to replace. Clients rely heavily on their chosen intermediaries not just for technical execution but also for navigating the complexities and risks of the offshore world. The non-substitutable nature of these trust-based relationships means that disrupting the intermediary side can significantly impact clients' access to and ability to maintain offshore structures, further highlighting the critical role of the supply-side actors.

Third, the structure of the market itself points towards the strategic importance of intermediaries. There often exists a many-to-one relationship between clients and intermediaries; that is, a relatively small number of specialized intermediary firms or key professionals service a large number of clients seeking offshore solutions. This concentration means that the intermediary sector represents a point of leverage. Regulatory actions or enforcement efforts focused on these key intermediary players could potentially have a cascading effect, impacting a wide network of clients far more efficiently than attempting to identify and pursue each individual client separately. This structural feature makes the intermediary supply-side particularly vulnerable, and thus relevant, from a regulatory perspective.

Finally, and crucially, these intermediaries are the gatekeepers of information. By the very nature of their role in designing, implementing, and managing offshore structures, they are the ones in possession of much of the detailed information – regarding beneficial ownership, asset locations, transaction flows, and the legal architecture employed – that is essential for tax authorities to effectively enforce tax laws. Their position as informational hubs further underscores the critical relevance of focusing on the supply-side dynamics within the offshore financial system.

\section{Research Gap: Understanding the \textit{Network Structure} to Inform Intermediary Regulation}
\label{sec:1_4}

While the significance of intermediaries in the offshore financial system is increasingly recognized, a specific gap remains in our understanding, particularly concerning the *structure* of the relationships connecting these actors. Considerable valuable research, particularly micro-sociological accounts like Harrington's (2016) ethnography, provides rich insights into the dyadic relationships, motivations, and practices of individual wealth managers and their clients. However, generalizing from these detailed qualitative studies to broader systemic patterns presents significant challenges.

Ethnography, as a methodology, certainly offers a powerful means of accessing and understanding micro-level dynamics that can illuminate macro-level phenomena or "megatrends," as suggested in related organizational literature. Yet, translating these nuanced observations into a systematic, potentially quantifiable, understanding of the overall architecture of the intermediary market requires complementary approaches.

A nascent thread of literature has begun to explore these structural aspects, often spurred by the availability of large-scale leaked data. Work such as Chang et al. (2023), alongside policy-oriented research emerging from bodies like the EU following disclosures such as the Panama Papers (e.g., research from 2017), represents initial steps in this direction. However, this line of inquiry remains limited thus far, often focusing on specific subsets of countries or actors. The analysis of the network structures inherent in the offshore world is still in a highly exploratory phase. Consequently, the potential held within detailed micro-data sources, such as the ICIJ leaks which map connections between entities, officers, and intermediaries on a vast scale, remains largely underexplored in terms of systematic structural analysis.

The work by Chang et al. (2023) on "Secrecy Strategies" provides a pertinent example. While their primary focus was on analyzing the *demand* strategies employed by global elites, their findings crucially demonstrate that these strategies are shaped by, and interact with, the *supply* landscape – the available intermediaries, jurisdictions, and the institutional context of the elites' home countries. Their research, therefore, implicitly highlights the importance of the supply structure by showing how it influences demand patterns, effectively linking the two sides of the market through observable strategic choices.

This points towards the specific research gap addressed herein: the need for a more systematic understanding of the *network structure* of the supply-side itself. While we have compelling accounts of individual intermediary roles and incentives, a comprehensive picture of how these intermediaries connect to each other, to different types of clients, across various jurisdictions, and through specific service offerings – essentially, the topology of the intermediary network – is lacking. Understanding this structure is potentially crucial for designing more effective regulation targeting these key players.

Therefore, the goal within this thesis is to contribute to bridging this gap, primarily through synthesis and systematization. Drawing upon the existing literature, including the rich ethnographic accounts, the aim here is not necessarily to conduct a novel quantitative network analysis but rather to attempt to codify some of the more loosely defined observations about intermediaries and their roles. By viewing these observations through the conceptual lens of network structures and positions, the objective is to formulate more general propositions regarding intermediary behavior, influence, and potential vulnerabilities within the broader offshore system. This effort seeks to systematize existing knowledge in a way that speaks to the structural relevance of the supply-side, even if the approach remains, in the interest of transparency, somewhat exploratory in nature.


Also a structural analysis of the network, is not very theory-driven and is interested in it more as a special kind of network, with distinct properties. Its authors note: "I don't know how anyone would try to bring this down, and I'm not sure that they would be able to. The system seems unattackable"
