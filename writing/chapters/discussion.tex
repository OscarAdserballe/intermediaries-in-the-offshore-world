Results from country network

Micro-states as Critical Hubs, Not Just Peripheries: The analysis (both centrality and the filtered graph) consistently shows that Micro-states (VGB, BMU, CYM, etc.) are not just passive recipients but act as essential, highly-connected nodes in the global intermediary network. VGB's top centrality and BMU's role in linking USA and China are striking.

Regime Type is Secondary for Strongest Links: The initial hypothesis that intermediaries specialize along regime lines is not supported by this "backbone" network. The Louvain communities are heterogeneous in regime type, and many of the highest-lift associations bridge countries with different political systems. This suggests that "relational capital" and specialization are built around other commonalities (e.g., financial niches, legal frameworks, tax environments).

Discovery of Specific, Powerful Triads/Clusters:
The USA-BMU-CHN/HKG (Comm 1) cluster is a major finding, indicating that Bermuda is a key jurisdiction for intermediaries navigating between these global economic giants. The very high lift values (especially CHN-BMU) point to highly specialized, non-random behaviors.
The VGB/CYM/WSM-SGP (part of Comm 0) cluster shows a strong Asia-Offshore link.

Effectiveness of Network Filtering: The chosen support and lift thresholds effectively cut through the noise of a dense full network to reveal a meaningful "backbone" of the most significant co-service relationships, allowing for clearer interpretation of underlying structures and key players.

Data-Driven Communities Reveal Operational Logic: The Louvain communities provide a more insightful grouping than regime types, suggesting that intermediaries organize their operations around distinct, albeit internally diverse, networks of countries. These communities likely represent different types of financial service ecosystems or historical/economic pathways.



Synthesis from Jurisdiction Network

Emergence of a "Dual-Purpose" Core: A significant cluster of jurisdictions, primarily within Louvain Community 1 (BHS, NIU, WSM, SYC, PAN, USA), is heavily utilized in tandem by intermediaries. Many of these are characterized by offering flexible "Dual-Purpose" legal technologies. NIU, in particular, shows up as a key connector with extremely high-lift associations.

VGB's Puzzling Absence from the Visual Backbone: The most central and frequently used jurisdiction overall (VGB) is not present in this filtered graph. This is a major finding, suggesting that its centrality stems from a vast number of connections that, individually, might not all meet the stringent lift/support criteria of this "backbone" view, or that the strongest co-incorporation patterns favor other hubs. This implies that sheer volume of use (VGB) and strongest paired usage (e.g., BHS-NIU) can highlight different aspects of the network.

Highly Specific and Powerful Pairings: The analysis reveals extremely high lift scores for certain jurisdiction pairs (e.g., AGO-BLZ, GBR-CRI, JEY-GGY), indicating very strong, non-random preferences by intermediaries. These point to specialized niches where using specific combinations of jurisdictions is a common strategy.

Distinct Communities of Practice: The Louvain communities effectively partition the network into groups of jurisdictions that are frequently used together by the same intermediaries, more so than grouping by legal technology alone.

Comm 1 (Brown) is the "Dual-Purpose" engine room.

Comm 0 (Dark Blue) clusters key financial centers like HKG and CYM with COK.

Comm 2 (Light Blue) groups other important jurisdictions that have strong, specific links even if they appear less central in this particular visual.

Legal Technologies as a Feature, Not a Definitive Grouping Principle: While jurisdictions in the core often offer "Dual-Purpose" technologies, the Louvain communities show that operational groupings are more nuanced. Intermediaries combine jurisdictions based on a range of factors beyond just the primary legal technology type, likely including specific use-cases, costs, reputation, and existing intermediary expertise spanning those locations.
