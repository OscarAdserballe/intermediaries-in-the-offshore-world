Onem ethod to operationalize identity concealment strategies: for very intermediary, we can count the number of bearer instrumnets tied to that given person, and then tie that to the person doing it. Then we can do something like a summing strategy acrosss countries using an indicator function if e.g. the perrson utilising this intermediary termed as "secretive"

"We operationalize identity concealment strategies as follows. First, for every client in the Offshore Leaks database, we count the number of nominees and bearer instruments their wealth manager employs"p

We can always just fall back to scarping the ones they have as the power players though definitely not very interesting as on this link:
